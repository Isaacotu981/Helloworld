This is to create an online store for a friend's business. 
I am a materials engineering student of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology located in Ghana. 
Programming has been an interesting area I have been wanting to explore since my early childhood years. I recently started learning to code on Sololearn and have completed HTML and CSS. To put what I have learnt into practice I have agreed to create an online store for a friend's business. The business isn't in operation yet. She is now about to start. The business is a fashion store where clothing, shoes, hairs etc will be sold.
